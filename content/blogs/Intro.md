Graduated in 2016 holding a BSc in Mathematics with Economics from University College London, I faced a professional career dilemma where I look to continue applying my analytic and problem-solving skills, but with a focus on practical (vs academic) outputs, clear goals and uses, and with a focus on societal impact.

“Consulting is vocational, we grow our people, we coach our clients, we produce lasting impact on the society and the economy… and we certainly require smart and analytical independent thinker”, were what convinced me to join Strategy&. In 5 years with the firm, I have had many opportunities solving critical issues for governments, agencies, and leading private sector players across South East Asia, Middle East, and Africa, with a focus on Strategy (Go-to-market, Digital, Growth), Optimisation (Cost and Resource, Supply Chain), and Large Program Management (PMO). I was awarded “Reimagine the Possible” by spearheading our digital offerings on operational and financial management analytics and had 3 cohort-jumps (or fast-tracks) to become an established Engagement Manager within the PwC and Strategy& network.

In July 2022, I started my London Business School adventure with my partner after 1-year deferral due to COVID crisis. With LBS, I further enhanced my analytical skills and continued to challenge what is possible and meaningful for leadership to make an informed and effective decision.
