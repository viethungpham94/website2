This is particularly interactive and powerful for the Program/Continuous Improvement Office to keep track of improvement readiness across the organisation, including training provided, past experience, and key topics for improvement. Network are generated based on hierachy, day to day relationship based on project work or work deployment, with tiering system on proximity of connection (e.g., distanced vs closely connected)
